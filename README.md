## Monitor LG 4K

Funny thing is, my Mac allows 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz, and 3840-by-2160 (4K) resolution at 30Hz on HDMI video
output. Therefore, the LG monitor can only display @ 30Hz although it's designed for 60Hz.

The pretty solution here is making use of Thunderbolt 2 port from the Mac, to connect with the DisplayPort of the LG
monitor, using Mini DisplayPort - DisplayPort cable :)
